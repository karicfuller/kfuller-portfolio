    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Basically I am an <span class "me">easy going</span>, t-shirt and jeans kinda girl. People usually find me to be <span class "me">scary and intimating</span> because of my appearance, but I'm really pretty <span class "me">down to earth</span>. My favorit color is pink, and my favorite t.v. show is Supernatural. I'm pretty much <span class "me">stuck in  the late 80's/early 90's</span> when it comes to music. I work in the Small Business Dept at Yahoo as a Product Support Rep. On the weekends I work at Starbucks. I've been with Yahoo for 4 years and Starbucks for 11 years. I enjoy working in technology as it is constantly changing which always keeps it interesting and challenging.</p>
